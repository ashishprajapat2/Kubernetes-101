**Beyond Docker: Your First Kubernetes App**

Welcome back to the DevOps Fundamentals series! In our last video, we learned how to containerize an application with Docker. But what happens when you need to manage dozens or even hundreds of containers? That's the problem Kubernetes solves.

In this video, we'll go beyond Docker and dive into the world of container orchestration. We'll demystify Kubernetes (often called K8s) by explaining its core concepts like Pods, Deployments, and Services.

You'll get a complete, hands-on walkthrough, including:

Why you need a container orchestrator for production environments.

How to write your first Kubernetes manifest files in YAML.

A live demo of deploying a scalable, multi-replica application.

A simple, clear explanation of why the LoadBalancer service type can be tricky in a local environment, and how to use kubectl port-forward to access your app.

How to scale your application up and down with a single command.

This video is the essential next step in your DevOps journey. By the end, you'll not only understand what Kubernetes is but also have deployed your very first containerized application at scale.
